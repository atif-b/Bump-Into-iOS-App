"Bump into" mobile provides opportunities for unexpected meetings between students in the contexy of the university. This can be used for both student-to-student messaging and sharing of contact details, as well as student-to-staff looking up relevant course staff details.

I am currently creating this app for iOS using the React Native framework.

Features include:
Login and Registration
User Profile
Profile sharing (via QR)
Add friends
1-to-1 chat
Bumped (Add friends via location)
